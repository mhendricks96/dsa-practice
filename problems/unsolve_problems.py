#given a bst, reverse the values
#given a queue, determine if a specific value is present recursively
# given a linked list, sort the values recursively
# given a queue, remove all duplicate values
# check if a binary tree is a sum tree or not(each nodes value is the same as the sum of all of its childrens values)
